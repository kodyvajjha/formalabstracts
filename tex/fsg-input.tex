\section{Affine varieties}


The material on finite groups of Lie type follows Carter
\cite{carter1985finite} and Humphreys \cite{humphreys2012linear}.

If $I$ is an ideal of a ring $R$, the radical $\sqrt{I}$ of $I$ is the
set of all $f \in R$ such that $f^e \in I$ for some $e\ge 1$.  The
radical of $I$ is an ideal.

Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field.  Let $A_K$ be the set of
finitely generated $K$-algebras without nilpotent elements.  This can
be made into a category, where the morphisms are morphisms of
$K$-algebras, but this category will not be directly needed.  An
affine variety $X$ over $K$ is uniquely determined by an element of
$A_K$.

An algebra $R\in A_K$ determines a set (the spectrum of $R$)
\[
\op{spec}(R) = \op{Hom}_{K-alg}(R,K)
\]
of $K$-algebra homomorphisms from $R$ to $K$.  The spectrum carries a
topology (the Zariski topology) uniquely determined by the condition
that a set $Y$ is closed iff there exists a a subset $S$ of $R$ such
that $Y=Z(S)$, where $Z(S)$ is the set of homomorphisms that vanish on
$S$.  We have $Z(S) = Z(\sqrt{(S)})$, where $(S)$ is the ideal
generated by $S$.

Although the data giving an affine variety $X$ and the algebra $R$ are
one and the same, we make a conceptual distinction, thinking of $X$ as
a geometric object, which has a spectrum (written $X(K)$) and a
coordinate ring (written $K[X]=R$).  We also call $X(K)$ the set of
$K$-points of $X$.

If $Z$ is a closed subset of an affine variety $X$, then the subset
$I(Z)$ on which every homomorphism in $Z$ vanishes is a radical ideal.
The Hilbert Nullstellensatz asserts that there is a bijection between
closed subsets of $X$ and radical ideals of $K[X]$ given by
\[
Z \mapsto I(Z),\quad I\mapsto Z(I).
\]

If $Z$ is a closed subset of an affine variety $X$, then $K[X]/I(Z)$
is an algebra in $A_K$, and $Z$ can be canonically identified with the
spectrum of $K[X]/I(Z)$ via the composition of $K$-algebra
homomorphisms
\[
K[X] \to K[X]/I(Z) \to K.
\]
In this way, each closed subset $Z$ of $X$ is an affine variety with
coordinate ring $K[Z] = K[X]/I(Z)$.

If $R,R'\in A_K$, then $R\otimes R'\in A_K$.  We have a product on
affine varieties given by
\[
K[X \times Y] = K[X]\otimes K[Y].
\]
This product satisfies the universal property of a product.

A morphism $f:X \to Y$ of affine varieties is defined to be a
$K$-algebra homomorphism $f^*:K[Y]\to K[X]$ (called the pull-back of
coordinate functions).  A morphism determines a map
\[
f_*: X(K) \to Y(K),
\]
by composition
\[
K[Y] \to K[X] \to K.
\]
This map is continuous.  The data giving $f$ and $f^*$ are one and the
same, but $f^*$ is contravariant, and we make a conceptual distinction
between them.

A point $1$ is an affine variety with $K[1]=K$.  It is a terminal
object; for each affine variety there is a unique morphism $f:X\to 1$.
Specifically, $f^*:K\to K[X]$ is the structure map of the $K$-algebra
$K[X]$.


\section{Affine algebraic groups}

Henceforth we refer to a group in the usual sense as abstract groups
to distinguish them from {\it affine groups}, which are group objects
in the category of affine categories, which are described in this
section.

An affine group over $K$ is defined as an affine variety
$G$, together with morphisms $\mu:G \times G \to G$ (called
multiplication) $i:G \to G$ (called inverse), and $e:1\to G$ (identity
element) such that $\mu$ and $i$ satisfy the usual axioms of a
group. More precisely, we mean the axioms of a group in the category
of affine algebraic groups.  For example, the right inverse property
is that this diagram commutes:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  G \arrow{r}{\op{id},i} \arrow{d} & G\times G \arrow{d}{\mu} \\
  1 \arrow{r}{e} & G
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
The other axioms are obtained by a similar translation of the group
axioms into categorical language.  The axioms are written explicitly
in the Wiki article on group object \cite{group-object}.  (These
axioms can also be expressed directly in $A_K$ as the axioms of a Hopf
algebra.)

If $G$ is an affine group, then the corresponding operations
on the spectrum
\[
\mu_*:G(K)\times G(K)\to G(K),\quad e_*(1)\in G(K),\quad i_*:G(K)\to G(K)
\]
make $G(K)$ into a group.


A morphism $f:G\to G'$ of affine algebraic groups is a morphism
of affine varieties such that $f(x y) = f(x) f(y)$.  That is,
this diagram commutes:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  G \times G \arrow{r}{\mu} \arrow{d}{(f,f)} & G \arrow{d}{f} \\
  G' \times G' \arrow{r}{\mu'} & G'
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

The point $1$ has the structure of an affine group.

The most important example of an affine algebraic group for us is
$GL(n)$ over $K$.  Let $R=K[x_0,x_{ij}:i=1,\ldots,n;j=1,\ldots,n]$ be
a polynomial ring in $n^2+1$ variables $x_0$ and $x_{ij}$.  Let
$\det(x_{ij})\in R$ be the determinant in $x_{ij}$.  Define $GL(n)$ as
an affine variety by its coordinate ring: $K[GL(n)] =
R/(x_0\det(x_{ij}) - 1)$.  We set $y_{ij} = x_{ij}\otimes 1$ and
$z_{ij} = 1\otimes x_{ij}$ in $K[GL(n)\times GL(n)]$.  Then
\[
K[GL(n)]\otimes K[GL(n)] \simeq
K[y_0,y_{ij},z_0,z_{ij}]/(y_0 \det(y_{ij})-1,z_0\det(z_{ij})-1).
\]

There exists a unique affine algebraic group $GL(n)$ with coordinate
ring $K[GL(n)]$ and
\begin{align*}
  e^*(x_{ij}) &= \delta_{ij} \text{ (Dirac delta function)},&e^*(x_0) &= 1\\
  \mu^*(x_{ij}) &= \sum_{i=1}^n {y_{ik} z_{kj}},&\mu^*(x_0) &= y_0 z_0\\
  i^* &= \text{adjugate formula for matrix inverse},&i^*(x_0)&=\det(x_{ij}).
\end{align*}
The adjugate formula appears here \cite{WA}.

If $a \in GL(n)(K) = GL(n,K) = \op{Hom}_{K-alg}(K[GL(n)],K)$, we write
$a_{ij}$ for $a(x_{ij})\in K$, and write it as an $n\times n$ matrix
with coefficients in $K$.  If $a_0 = a(x_0)$, then
$a_0\det(a_{ij})=1$, so that the determinant of the matrix is nonzero.
In fact, the element $x_0$ appears exactly for the purpose of
expressing the non-zero determinant condition as a polynomial
equation.

If $G$ and $G'$ are affine groups, then $G \times G'$ also
carries the structure of an affine group in a natural way.

When $n=1$, we also write $\Gm = GL(1)$.
The coordinate ring is $K[t,u]/(t u - 1)\simeq K[t,t^{-1}]$.
Also, $\Gm^r
=\Gm \times \cdots \times \Gm$ for the $r$-fold product.
The coordinate ring is
\[
K[\Gm^r]=K[\Gm]\otimes\cdots\otimes K[\Gm]
\simeq K[t_1,t_1^{-1},\ldots,t_r,t_r^{-1}].
\]



A closed subgroup $H$ of an affine group $G$ is a closed subvariety
that contains the neutral element and such that the inverse and
multiplication on $G$ restrict to $H$.  Then $H$ has the structure of
an affine group.  In what follows, being {\it closed} refers to the
Zariski topology and to the algebraic sense in which a binary
operation can be closed.

We give the definition of the commutator subgroup $[A,B]$ for two
(Zariski) closed subgroups of $G$.  (The definition is a bit more
involved in the category of affine groups than in the category of
abstract groups.)  The commutator for elements $a,b$ of an abstract
group is $[a,b] = a^{-1}b^{-1} a b$.  We write this as a morphism
$A\times B \to G$, $(a,b)\to [a,b]$, where we now no longer think
of $a$ and $b$ as elements of the groups $A$ and $B$ but as
tracers that display the composition of morphisms in the category of
affine groups:
\begin{align*}
  &A \times B &&\to A\times A \times B \times B
  &&\to A \times B \times A\times B
  &&\to A \times B \times A\times B  
  &&\to G\\
&(a,b) &&\mapsto (a,a,b,b) &&\mapsto (a,b,a,b) &&\mapsto (a^{-1},b^{-1},a,b) &&\mapsto [a,b].
\end{align*}
The first arrow is a pair of diagonal maps, followed by a swap, then
a pair of inverses, then a composition of multiplications (in any
order).

The commutator subgroup $[A,B]$ is the group {\it generated} by
commutators.
\[
(A\times B)^k \to G,\quad (a_1,b_1,\ldots,a_k,b_k)\to [a_1,b_1]\cdots[a_k,b_k]
\]
Further details appear in \cite{humphreys2012linear}, including
conditions that ensure that the commutator subgroup is (Zariski)
closed in $G$.

The commutator of two normal subgroups is again normal.  The
commutator when one group $A$ or $B$ is connected is again connected.

An affine variety $X$ is said to be irreducible if $K[X]$ is an
integral domain.  (Equivalently, $X$ is irreducible if the spectrum
$X(K)$ cannot be written as the union of two proper closed subsets).
If $X$ is irreducible, the quotient field $K(X)$ of $K[X]$ is called
the function field of $X$.  In this case, $K(X)$ has finite
transcendence degree over $K$, and we say that the dimension of $X$ is
that degree.

The group affine group $\Gm^r$ is irreducible, and its
dimension is $r$.


An affine group $G$ is connected (as a topological space) if and only
if it is irreducible.  A connected affine group $G$ is nilpotent if
\[
G = G_1 \supset G_2 \supset \cdots \supset G_{c+1}=1,
\]
where $G_{i+1} = [G_i,G]$.  Each $G_i$ is a normal closed connected subgroup
of $G$.
A connected affine group $G$ is solvable if
\[
G = G^{(0)} \supset G^{(d)} = 1,
\]
where $G^{(i+1)} = [G^{(i)},G^{(i)}]$.  Each $G^{(i)}$ is a normal closed
connected subgroup of $G$. We also write $G' = G^{(1)}$.

A Borel $B$ subgroup of $G$ is a maximal closed connected solvable
subgroup of $G$.  Borel subgroups always exist and all Borel subgroups
are conjugate to one another.

A maximal torus of $G$ is closed subgroup of that is isomorphic to
$\Gm^r$, with $r$ as large as possible.  We call $r$ the rank
of $G$.  A maximal torus exists and all maximal tori are conjugate to
one another.  Each maximal torus is a closed subgroup of some Borel
subgroup.

Let $T$ be a maximal torus of $G$.  The character group of $T$
is the set
\[
X^*(T) = \op{Hom}(T,\Gm).
\]
It has the structure of (an abstract) abelian group as follows.  $T$
is isomorphic to $\Gm^r$ for some $r$ and the abelian group
structure comes by transport of structure along that isomorphism.
\begin{align*}
\ring{Z}^r &\simeq
\op{Hom}_{K-alg}(K[t,t^{-1}],K[t_1,t_1^{-1},\ldots,t_r,t_r^{-1}])
= \op{Hom}(\Gm^r,\Gm),\\
(m_1,\ldots,m_r)&\mapsto (t\mapsto t_1^{m_1}\cdots t_r^{m_r}).
\end{align*}
In particular, $X^*(T)$ is a free abelian group of rank $r$.

The cocharacter group of $T$ is
\[
X_*(T) = \op{Hom}(\Gm,T),
\]
which also has the structure of a free abelian group of rank $r$
by transport of structure:
\begin{align*}
\ring{Z}^r &\simeq
\op{Hom}_{K-alg}(K[t_1,t_1^{-1},\ldots,t_r,t_r^{-1}],K[t,t^{-1}])
= \op{Hom}(\Gm,\Gm^r),\\
(m_1,\ldots,m_r)&\mapsto (t_i\mapsto t^{m_i}).
\end{align*}

There is a nondegenerate bilinear pairing
\[
\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle:X^*(T)\times X_*(T)\to \ring{Z},
\]
given by the composition
\[
\langle \lambda,\mu\rangle =
\lambda\circ\mu \in \op{Hom}(\Gm,\Gm) = \ring{Z}
\]


An affine group $U$ is unipotent if it is isomorphic to a closed
subgroup of the strictly upper triangular subgroup of $GL(n)$ for some
$n$.  (This is the closed subgroup of $GL(n)$ given by $x_{ij}=0$ for
all $i>j$, and $x_{ii}=x_0 = 1$.)

An example of a unipotent subgroup is the additive group $\Ga$.
Its coordinate ring is defined as $K[\Ga] = K[x]$, a polynomial
ring in one variable.  The group structure is uniquely determined by
the conditions:
\begin{align*}
  e^*(x)=0,\quad i^*(x)= -x,\quad
  \mu^*(x) = x\otimes 1 + 1\otimes x\in K[x]\otimes K[x].
\end{align*}
$\Ga$ is isomorphic to the group $U$ of strictly upper
triangular matrices of $GL(2)$ through
\[
K[U]= K[x_0,x_{ij}]/(x_0=1,x_{11}=x_{22}=1,x_{21}=0)
\simeq K[x_{12}] \simeq K[x].
\]
The group $\Gm$ acts as automorphisms of $\Ga$ by the
morphism
\[
\Gm\times \Ga\to \Ga,\quad K[x]\to K[t,t^{-1}]\otimes K[x],
\quad x\mapsto t\otimes x.
\]

A connected affine group $G$ is reductive the only normal closed
connected unipotent subgroup of $G$ is $1$.  A connected affine group
$G$ is semisimple if $G\ne 1$ and if the only normal closed connected
solvable subgroup $G$ is $1$.  A unipotent subgroup is solvable, hence
a semisimple group is also reductive.  An affine group is $G$ is
almost simple if it has no proper normal closed connected subgroup.
An almost simple group is connected and semisimple.

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group, and let $T$ be a maximal torus
of $G$.  The torus $T$ is a closed subgroup of some Borel subgroup $B$
of $G$, giving $T\subset B\subset G$.  There is a unique Borel
subgroup $B^-$ such that $B\cap B^- = T$.  The derived subgroups of
$B' = U$ and $B^{-'} = U'$ are unipotent subgroups of $G$.

If $X$ is a subgroup of $U$ or $U^-$ that is normalized by $T$ and
that is isomorphic (by $f$) to $\Ga$, then there exists a
unique element $\lambda\in X^*(T)$ such that $T$ acts on $X$ by
\[
T\times X\to^{\lambda,f} \Gm \times \Ga
\to \Ga \to^{f^{-1}} X,
\]
using the action of $\Gm$ on $\Ga$ given above.  The
element $\lambda\in X^*(T)$ attached to $X$ is called a root, and $X =
X_\lambda$ is called a root space.  The set $\Phi$ of roots is a
finite subset of $X^*(T)$ and is independent of the choice of Borel
subgroup $B$.  If $\alpha\in \Phi$ then $-\alpha\in \Phi$.


%\begin{example}
%The affine group $SL(2)$ is the closed subgroup of $GL(2)$ given by
%$\det(x_{ij})=1$.  The group $SL(2)$ has rank 1.  A maximal torus is
%given by the diagonal subgroup
%\[
%d(t) = \begin{pmatrix}t &0 \\ 0 & t^{-1} \end{pmatrix}
%\]
%The character lattice of $SL(2)$ is isomorphic to $\ring{Z}$ with
%$\lambda_n(d(t)) = t^n$, for $n\in\ring{Z}$. There are two roots $\Phi
%= \{\pm\alpha\}$, identified with $\pm2\in\ring{Z}$.  The cocharacter
%lattice is isomorphic to $\ring{Z}$ with $\mu_n(t) = d(t^n)$, for
%$n\in\ring{Z}$.  We define set $\Phi^\vee$ of the coroots $\pm\alpha^\vee$
%of $SL(2)$ to be the two cocharacters identified with $\pm1\in Z\simeq
%X_*(T)$.  Under the pairing $\langle\alpha,\alpha^\vee\rangle=2$.
%\end{example}

Now continue with a reductive group $G$ with Borel subgroup $B$
containing maximal torus $T$.  Let $\alpha\in\Phi$, let
$T_\alpha\subset T$ be the kernel of $\alpha: T\to \Gm$, and
let $M_\alpha$ be the centralizer of $T_\alpha$ with derived group
$M_\alpha'$.  The affine group $M_\alpha'$ is semisimple of rank 1
with maximal torus $S \subset T \cap M_\alpha'$.  There exists a
unique cocharacter $\alpha^\vee\in X_*(T)$ factoring through $S$
\[
\alpha^\vee:\Gm\to S \to T
\]
and such that $\langle \alpha,\alpha^\vee\rangle = 2$.  Running over
$\alpha\in \Phi$, the set of all $\alpha^\vee$ so obtained is called the
set of coroots $\Phi^\vee\subset X_*(T)$.

%There exists a
%homomorphism $\phi:SL(2)\to M_\alpha'$, sending the (diagonal)
%maximal torus $S$ of $SL(2)$ into $M_\alpha'\cap T$ and by
%composition $S \to T \to^\alpha \Gm$, sending
%$\pm\alpha\mapsto\pm\alpha \in \Phi_{SL(2)}$.  Define
%$\pm\alpha^\vee\in X_*(T)$ to be the cocharacters obtained by
%composition
%\[
%\pm\alpha^\vee \in X_*(S) \to X_*(T),\quad \Gm\to S \to^\phi T.
%\]

The reductive group $G$ is semisimple iff the subgroup $\ring{Z}\Phi$
generated by $\Phi$ in $X^*(T)$ has finite index in $X^*(T)$.  This
occurs iff the subgroup $\ring{Z}\Phi^\vee$ has finite index in $X_*(T)$.
We say that a semisimple group is simply connected in the case of
equality: $\ring{Z}\Phi^\vee = X_*(T)$.

\section{Classification of Almost Simple Affine Groups}

We say that $\lambda\in\Phi$ is positive if the root space $X_\lambda$
is a closed subgroup of $U$ (and negative otherwise).  Let $\ell$ be
the rank of $\ring{Z}\Phi$.  There exists a set $\Delta$ of
cardinality $\ell$ of positive roots (called the set of simple
positive roots) such that every positive root is a linear combination
of them with nonnegative coefficients.  That is, every positive root is
in the cone spaned by the simple positive roots.
(The set $\Delta$ depends on the choices $T\subset B\subset G$.)

Let $A_{ij} = \langle \alpha_j,\alpha_i^\vee\rangle\in\ring{Z}$, for
some enumeration $\alpha_i$ of $\Delta$.
This matrix (called the Cartan matrix) has the following properties.
\begin{itemize}
\item $A_{ij}\in \{2,0,-1,-2,-3\}$.
\item $A_{ii}=2$.
\item $A_{ij}\le 0$ for all $i\ne j$.
\item $A_{ij}=0$ iff $A_{ji}=0$.
\item If $A_{ij}<-1$, then $A_{ji}=-1$.
  \end{itemize}

The Dynkin diagram of $G$ is a graph (with no loops and no multiple
joins) with $\ell$ nodes, indexed by $\Delta$, which we now describe.
Edges of the graph are optionally decorated with an integer $2$ or $3$
and an ordering of the endpoints (an arrow from node $\alpha$ to node
$\beta$).  Two distinct nodes are connected by an edge iff $A_{ij}\ne
0$.  The edge is not decorated if $A_{ij}=A_{ji}=-1$.  But if
$A_{ji}\ne -1,0$, then the edge is decorated with the integer
$-A_{ji}$ and an arrow from $\alpha_i$ to $\alpha_j$.  The integer $2$
or $3$ is often depicted as a double or triple bond in the graph.

A connected semisimple group $G$ is almost simple if and only if
its Dynkin diagram is a connected graph.

The connected Dynkin diagrams of almost simple groups $G$ over $K$
follow a well known classification.

%(give abstract root system.)

The classification of almost simple simply connected groups
can be stated as follows.
Let $D$ be a connected Dynkin diagram appearing in the list.

Classification Theorem: There exists an almost simple simply connected
group $G$ over $K$ such that the construction of
$(X^*(T),\Phi,X_*(T),\Phi^\vee)$ gives a root system $\Phi$ whose
Dynkin diagram is isomorphic to $D$.  If $G,G'$ are two almost simple
simply connected groups over $K$ that both have Dynkin diagram
isomorphic to $D$, then $G$ and $G'$ are isomorphic as affine groups.

There exists a similar classification for all reductive groups by all
four tuples as above, but this will not be needed.

A linear algebraic group $G$ is an affine group that is isomorphic to
a closed subgroup of $GL(n)$ for some $n$. It is known that every
affine algebraic group is linear (see Humphreys's texbook
\cite{humphreys2012linear}).

\section{Finite groups of Lie Type}

Now let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$.

Let $q = p^e$ for some $e\ge 1$.  Let $F_q:K\to K$ be the
Frobenius map $a\mapsto a^q$. It is an automorphism of the field $K$.

There is a homomorphism $F_q:GL(n)\to GL(n)$ given on coordinate rings
by
\[
F_q^*(x_{ij}) = x_{ij}^q,\quad F_q^*(x_0) = x_0^q.
\]
Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group over $K$.  A standard Frobenius
map $F:G\to G$ is a homomorphism obtained from an injective
homomorphism $\phi:G\to GL(n)$ such that $\phi\circ F = F_q \circ
\phi$.  A Frobenius map $F:G\to G$ is a homomorphism such that some
power of $F$ is a standard Frobenius map.

%We have seen that the elements of $GL(n,K)$ are in natural
%correspondence with matrices $(a_{ij})$ in $K$ with nonzero
%determinant.  $GL(n,K)$ is a group and
%\[
%F_q:GL(n,K)\to GL(n,K),\quad (a_{ij})\mapsto (a_{ij}^q)
%\]
%is a homomorphism.  The kernel $GL(n,K)^{F_q}$ of $F_q$ is the finite
%group $GL(n,\ring{F}_q)$, where $\ring{F}_q$ is the fixed field
%$K^{F_q}$.

Let $G$ be a reductive group with Frobenius map $F:G\to G$.  There
exists a maximal torus $T$ and Borel subgroup $B$ of $G$ such that
$T\subset B\subset G$, and such that $F(T)=T$ and $F(B)=B$.  Fix such
a pair $(T,B)$.  The Frobenius $F$ acts on $X_*(T)$ by
\[
(F(\lambda)) t = \lambda(F(t)),\quad \lambda\in X^*(T),\quad t\in T(K).
\]

Let $X_{\ring{R}} = X_*(T)\otimes_\ring{Z} \ring{R}$.  The action of
$F$ on the first factor $X_*(T)$ gives a linear action of $F$ on
$X_{\ring{R}}$.  There is a positive real number $q > 1$ such that $q$
is the absolute value of all the eigenvalues of $F$ on $X_{\ring{R}}$.
Then $q = p^e$ for some positive rational number $e$, where $p$ is the
characteristic of $K$.


The Frobenius $F$ permutes the set of root spaces $X_\lambda$, and
there is a unique permutation $\rho:\Phi\to\Phi$ such that
$F(X_\lambda) = X_{\rho\lambda}$.  This permutation $\rho$ restricts
to give a permutation $\rho:\Delta\to\Delta$ of positive simple roots.
This uniquely determines an automorphism $\rho$ of the Dynkin diagram
that respects the integer labels on edges, but that does not always
respect the direction of the arrows labels on edges.  There is a
compatibility constraint that if an edge carries a label $p =2,3$,
then the characteristic of $K$ is $p$.


Let $G$ be almost simple and simply connected over $K$.  We have seen
that it is classified by its Dynkin diagram.  A finite group of Lie
type $G^F$ obtained from $G$ is classified by two additional
ingredients: the order of $\rho$ on the Dynkin diagram, and the number
$q = p^e$.

The automorphism $\rho$ of the Dynkin diagram is determined by its
order, and the symbol for the Dynkin diagram is decorated with a
prepended superscript indicating the order.  If $\rho=1$ the
superscript is omitted.  The data $(D,\rho,p^e)$ is thus written
${}^\rho D(q)$ or $D(q)$.  Here is the classification.  $p$ is any
prime. $e\in\ring{N}$, with $e\ge 1$.

\begin{itemize}
\item $A_r(p^e)$, where $r\ge 1$.
\item $B_r(p^e)$, where $r\ge 2$.
\item $C_r(p^e)$, where $r\ge 3$.
\item $D_r(p^e)$, where $r\ge 4$
\item ${}^2A_r(p^e)$, where $r\ge 1$.
\item ${}^2D_r(p^e)$, where $r\ge 4$.
\item ${}^3D_4(p^e)$.
\item $G_2(p^e)$.
\item $F_4(p^e)$.
\item $E_6(p^e)$.
\item ${}^2E_6(p^e)$.
\item $E_7(p^e)$.
\item $E_8(p^e)$.
\item ${}^2B_2(2^{f+1/2})$, where $f\in\ring{N}$.
\item ${}^2G_2(3^{f+1/2})$, where $f\in\ring{N}$.
\item ${}^2F_4(2^{f+1/2})$, where $f\in\ring{N}$.
\end{itemize}



The classification means that every $(D,\rho,q)$ is realized by some
$G^F$ (where $G$ is almost simple simply connected) and if two groups
$G^F$ and $G^F$ have equivalent data $(D,\rho,q)$, they are
isomorphic.  There are choices involved in constructing data
$(D,\rho,q)$ from $G^F$, and in rare cases, isomorphic groups can have
inequivalent data.  These duplicates have been classified.

The corresponding simple group is $G^F/Z(G^F)$.


\section{Comments about Notation}

``$A \times B$ denotes a direct product, with normal subgroups $A and
B$; also $A:B$ denotes a semidirect product (or split extension), with
a normal subgroup A and subgroup $B$; and $A \cdot B$ denotes a
non-split extension, with a normal subgroup $A$ and quotient $B$, but
no subgroup $B$; finally $A.B$ or just $AB$ denotes an unspecified
extension" \cite[p.9]{wilson2009finite}. (For sequences of dots, what
is the operator precedence and associativity of this notation?)

If $p$ is prime, $p^n$ denotes a direct product of $n$ cyclic groups
of order $p$.  That is, $p^n$ is elementary abelian group of order
$p^n$.  \cite[p.9]{wilson2009finite}

$Z(G)$ and $G'$ denote the center and derived subgroup of $G$,
respectively.

Let $p$ be a prime.  An extraspecial $p$-group is a finite $p$-group
$P$ such that $P' = Z(P)$ and $P'$ has order $p$.  Then $P$ has order
$p^{1+2n}$, for some positive $n$.  For each $p,n$, there are two
extraspecial $p$-groups of a given order up to isomorphism, denoted
$p^{1+2n}_{\pm}$. The signs are determined by the following rules.  If
$p$ is odd, the sign is $+$ iff $P$ has exponent $p$ (that is, every
non-identity element has order $p$).  If $p=2$, the function $x$ to
$x^2$ on $P$ induces a map $P/P'$ to $Z(P)$, which turns out to be a
quadratic form on the vector space $P/P'$.  The notation $+$ means
that the quadratic form has an isotropic vector, and $-$ otherwise
(for an anisotropic form) \cite[p.19]{robert1998twelve},
\cite[pp.59,83]{wilson2009finite}.

The term {\it almost simple} is used in the sense of Lie theory (that
is, having a simple Lie algebra, or equivalently noncommutative and
having no proper closed connected normal subgroups) and not in the
sense used by \cite[p.22]{wilson2009finite}.

$S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters, and $Alt_n$ is the
alternating subgroup of index two in $S_n$.

$O_p(G)$ denotes the $p$-core of the finite group $G$.  It
is the largest normal $p$-subgroup of $G$.  It is the intersection
of Sylow $p$-subgroups.


\section{Sporadic Groups} 

The lists above specify all but the last $26$ finite simple groups,
called the sporadic groups.  The $26$ sporadic groups are classified
into three happy families $(5+7+8)$ and the six pariahs.  A useful
reference is the atlas of sporadic groups \cite{A}.

\subsection{First Happy Family (Mathieu groups)} \label{sec:first-happy-family}

The first happy family (of $5$) are the Mathieu groups.  These are quite
elementary to specify in terms of automorphism groups of Steiner
systems and their subgroups.

\begin{itemize}
\item A Steiner system $S(t,k,v)$, where $t < k < v$ are positive
  integers is a finite set $X$ of cardinality $v$, a collection of $k$
  element subsets of $X$ (called blocks), such that each $t$ element
  subset of $X$ is contained in a unique block. \label{itm:steiner-system-def}
\item The Steiner system $S(5,8,24)$ \label{itm:steiner-system-5-8-24} exists and is unique up to
  isomorphism.  The automorphism group of this Steiner system is
  $M_{24}$ \label{mathieu-group-M24}(which by construction is a subgroup of $S_{24}$).  The
  stabilizer of a point $x$ (in the $24$ element set $X$) is $M_{23}$ \label{mathieu-group-M23},
  and the stablizer of two distinct points is $M_{22}$.\label{mathieu-group-M22}
\item The Steiner system $S(5,6,12)$ exists and is unique up to
  isomorphism.  The automorphism group of this Steiner system is
  $M_{12}$.  The stabilizer of a point is $M_{11}$. \label{itm:steiner-system-5-6-12}
\item The isomorphism class of the finite simple groups $M_{24}$,
  $M_{23}$, $M_{22}$, $M_{12}$, and $M_{11}$ does not depend on any of
  the choices in this construction. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Second Happy Family and the Leech lattice} \label{sec:second-happy-family}

The second happy family (of 7) are those related to the Leech lattice.
\begin{itemize}
\item The Leech lattice $L=L24$ can be characterized as the unique
  even unimodular lattice in dimension $24$ that does not have any
  vectors of norm 2.  Norm means the length squared here.
\item $Co_1 = Aut_0(L)/\{\pm 1\}$, where $A=Aut_0(L) \subset O(24)$ is
  the subgroup of the automorphism group of $L$ fixing the origin.
\item $Co_2 \subseteq A$ is the stabilizer of any vector of norm $4$
  (that is, any nonzero vector of shortest length).
\item $Co_3 \subseteq  A$ is the stabilizer of any vector of norm $6$.
\item $McL \subseteq Co_3$ is the stabilizer of any pair of vectors
  $v,w\in L$ such that $v$ has norm $6$, $w$ has norm $4$, and with
  inner product $(w,v) = -3$.  Equivalently $McL$ is the stabilizer of
  any pair of vectors $v,w$ of norm $4$, such that $(w,v) = -1$.
\item $HS \subseteq Co_3$ is the stabilizer of any pair of vectors
  $v,w$ in $L$ such that $v$ has norm $6$ and $w$ is a vector of norm
  $4$, such that $(w,v) = -2$.  Equivalently, $HS$ is a rank $3$
  permutation group on $100$ points in which a point stabilizer is
  isomorphic to $M_{22}$. \cite[p.116]{robert1998twelve}.  (Rank $3$
  permutation group is defined below in the pariah section.)
\item $J_2$.  $Co_1$ has a subgroup of order $3$ whose normalizer is
  isomorphic to $Alt_9 \times S_3$.  The $Alt_9$ factor has subgroup
  $Alt_5$, and the centralizer of $Alt_5$ in $Co_1$ is $J_2$
  \cite[p.218]{wilson2009finite}.
\item Suz.  In continuation of the construction of the subgroups
  $Alt_9 \times S_3$ and $Alt_5$ in $Co_1$, the group $Alt_5$ has a
  subgroup $Alt_3$.  The centralizer of $Alt_3$ in $Co_1$ is $3\cdot
  Suz$, a $3$-fold central cover of $Suz$.
  \cite[p.218]{wilson2009finite}.
\item The isomorphism class of the finite simple groups $Co_1$,
  $Co_2$, $Co_3$, $McL$, $HS$, $J_2$, $Suz$ do not depend on any of
  the choices in the construction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{monster}  \label{monster}

The third happy family (of 8) are those related to the Fischer-Griess
monster group $M$.  A construction of the monster is needed.

\begin{itemize}
 \item
 Here is a construction of the monster (up to a factor of
 2) as the quotient of an infinite Coxeter group by one
 additional relation \cite{P}.  This gives a quick
 construction. (Compare \cite[sec.5.8.5]{wilson2009finite}.)
\item The monster can also be described up to isomorphism as the
  finite simple group that contains a pair of involutions $z,t$, such
  that the centralizer of $z$ is isomorphic to $2^{1+24}_{+}Co_1$ and
  the centralizer of $t$ is isomorphic to the baby monster
  $B$. \cite[p.148]{robert1998twelve}.  This approach requires us to
  have a prior construction of $B$.
\item A third possible route to the monster is the construction of the
  Griess algebra, which has the monster as its automorphism group.
  (See the sketches in \cite[p.146]{robert1998twelve} and
  \cite[p.251]{wilson2009finite}.)  A fourth construction is through
  the monster vertex algebra \cite{VOA}.
\end{itemize}

The monster group has an elementary presentation in terms of a
quotient of an infinite Coxeter group \cite{JNB} \cite{P}.

We define a Coxeter group $Y_{443}$.  The Coxeter graph is associated
with a Coxter graph with $12$ vertices:
\[
v_{ij},\quad i=0,1,2,\quad j=0,..,3.
\]
We construct an undirected graph with $9$ edges
$\{v_{ij},v_{i,{j+1}}\}$, for $j<3$, and with two additional edges
that connect the graph:
\[
\{v_{00},v_{10}\}, \{v_{00},v_{20}\}.
\]
Write $E$ for this set of $11$ edges.

Note: the graph is in the shape of a $Y$ with three arms $v_{ij}$, for
$i=0,1,2$.

The associated Coxeter group $Y_{433}$ is the group given by $12$
generators and the following relations.

Generators:
\[
x_{ij}, \quad i=0,1,2,\quad j=0,..,3.
\]

Relations:
\[
\forall i j, \quad (x_{ij}x_{i'j'})^{m(i,j,i',j')} = 1,
\]
where
\[
m(i,j,i',j') = 
\begin{cases}
1,&\text{if } (i,j) = (i',j');\\
3,&\text{if }  \{v_{ij},v_{i'j'}\}\in E;\\
2,&\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

This defines $Y_{433}$.  We define $G$ to be the quotient of $Y_{433}$ by
the additional relation (called the spider relation):
\[
(x_{00}x_{20}x_{21} x_{00}x_{10}x_{11} x_{00} x_{01} x_{02})^{10} = 1.
\]
This quotient is $2 \times M$.



\subsection{Third Happy Family and the Monster} \label{third-happy-family}

 
\begin{itemize}
\item $M$.  The monster is characterized above and has an atlas page
  with further useful information \cite{AM}.
\item $B$.  $2\cdot B$ is a centralizer of an involution in $2A$ in $M$
  \cite[p.256]{wilson2009finite}.  ($2A$ is specified below.)
\item $Fi_{24}'$.  $3\cdot Fi_{24}'$ is a centralizer of an element $x$ in
  the conjugacy class $3A$ of order $3$ in $M$ \cite[p.256-257]{wilson2009finite}.
  Moreover, $3\cdot Fi_{24}$ is the normalizer of the subgroup $\langle x\rangle $.
\item $Fi_{23}$.  This is a subgroup of $Fi_{24}'$ described below.
\item $Fi_{22}$.  This is a subgroup of $Fi_{24}'$ described below.
          %Equivalently, the normalizer $N_M(<6A>)$ of the subgroup
          %generated by an element in conjugacy class $6A$ of order
          %$6$ is $(S_3 \times 2\cdot Fi_{22}).2.$
\item $Th$.  Let $x$ be an element of order three in the conjugacy
  class $3C$, then $Th = C_M(\langle x\rangle )/\langle x\rangle $.
            %The monster has a involution whose centralizer is
          %isomorphic to $2^{1+24}\cdot Co_1$ \cite[p.253]{wilson2009finite}.  Take an
          %element ``$x$ of order three from $2^{1+24}\cdot Co_1$, such
          %that $x$ maps to an element of Co_1 with centralizer 3
          %\times Alt_9."  Then N_M(\langle x\rangle ) \simeq S_3 \times Th
\item $HN$.  Let $x$ be an element of conjugacy class $5A$ in $M$.
  Then $HN \simeq C_M(x)/\langle x\rangle $ \cite[p.262]{wilson2009finite}.
  %\cite[p.260]{wilson2009finite}.  More directly,
          %``If x is an element of order 5 in 2^{1+24}\cdot Co_1,
          %mapping to an element of class 5B in the quotient group of
          %Co_1, then its centralizer has shape 5 \times 2^{1+8}\cdot
          %(Alt_5 \times Alt_5).2."  Then HN \simeq C_M(x)/\langle x\rangle 
          %\cite[p.262]{wilson2009finite}.  (5B in Co_1 is \cite{ACo1} defined in the
          %altas.) More directly,
\item He.  Let $x$ be an element in conjugacy class $7A$ in $M$.  Then
  $He \simeq C_M(x)/\langle x\rangle.$ \cite[p.263]{wilson2009finite}.  %More directly,
          %If x is any element 7A in M, then its normalizer in
          %M is (7:3 \times  He):2, where He is the Held group
\end{itemize}

These constructions mention conjugacy classes $2A$, $3A$, $3C$, $5A$,
$6A$, $7A$ in $M$. Classes are labeled $NX$, where $N=1,2,3,4,5,6$ is
the order of an element in the conjugacy class, and $X=A,B,\ldots$ are
letters to differentiate the conjugacy classes of a given order, $A$
is the class of smallest cardinality of that order, $B$ is the second
smallest, etc.  In general there can be classes of the same order and
cardinality, but that does not happen with any of the orders in $M$ we
discuss.  In particular, $2A$ is the smallest conjugacy class of order
$2$, and $3A$ is the smallest conjugacy class of order $3$.  The
product of two elements of $2A$ can land in any of nine different
conjugacy classes: $1A$, $2A$, $2B$, $3A$, $3C$, $4A$, $4B$, $5A$,
$6A$.  See \cite[p.7]{Ga} and \cite[p256]{wilson2009finite}.

A $3$-transposition group is a ``finite group $G$ generated by a
conjugacy class $D$ of involutions, such that any two elements of $D$
have a product of order at most $3$, and ... such that $G' = G''$ and
any normal $2$- or $3$-subgroup of $G$ is central''
\cite[p235]{wilson2009finite}.  We call the elements of $D$
transpositions.  There is a classification of $3$-transposition
groups.  There is a $3$-transposition group such that its quotient by
its center is $Fi_n$, for $n=22,23,24$.

\begin{itemize}
\item $Fi_{23}$.
  The stabilizer of one transposition in $Fi_{24}'$ is $Fi_{23}$.
\item $Fi_{22}$.  The stabilizer of two commuting transpositions in
  $Fi_{24}'$ is $2\cdot Fi_{22}:2$. \cite[p.250]{wilson2009finite}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Pariahs} \label{pariahs}

It is not clear what the best route to the six pariahs will be.
Expert opinion is needed.  At the very least we might specify them as
the unique simple group of a given order, even if that is not a very
useful description.  ``The behavior of these six groups is so bizarre
that any attempt to describe them ends up looking like a disconnected
sequence of related facts." \cite[p.184]{wilson2009finite}.
\cite[pp.150-153]{robert1998twelve} gives a brief description of each
pariah.

\begin{itemize}
\item $J_1$.  ``It is the unique simple group which has abelian Sylow
  $2$-groups and contains an involution with centralizer isomorphic to''
  $2 \times Alt_5$.   \cite[p.150]{robert1998twelve}
          %Moreover, it was
          %"constructed by computer by John Cannon as a subgroup of
          %G2(11) generated by a pair of degree 7 matrices over the
          %integers modulo 11."
\item $J_3$. This group appears in a centralizer involution problem.
  %``This is a group discovered by Janko as a solution to a
  %centralizer of involution problem.  ``The involution centralizer is
  $2^{1+4}_{-}:Alt_5$, split extension (therefore not the standard
  holomorph, which embeds in $GL(4,C)$)''
  \cite[p.151]{robert1998twelve}.  There are two finite simple groups
  with this involution centralizer.  The other is $J_2$, which appears
  in the second happy family.  $J_3$ has order $2^7\,3^5\,5.17.19$."
\item $Ly$.  This group is uniquely characterized up to isomorphism as
  a finite simple group that contains an involution whose centralizer
  is isomorphic to $2 \cdot Alt_{11}$, the covering group of the
  alternating group of degree $11$.  Moreover, the group has a single
  class of involutions and has order
  $2^8*3^5*5*7*11*37*61*67$. \cite[p.151]{robert1998twelve}
\item $O'N$. This is the unique simple group $G$ up to isomorphism
  with the following properties \cite[p.152]{robert1998twelve}:
\begin{itemize}
\item For every elementary subgroup $E$ of $G$, we have
 $N_G(E)/C_G(E) \simeq GL(E)$.
 %[correcting a typo: $N_E(E)$ to N_G(E).]
 \item $G$ contains a subgroup $E \simeq 2^3$
 such that $N_G(E) \simeq 4^3 \cdot 
 GL(3,2)$
 \item $G$ contains an involution whose centralizer has the form
 $4.PSL(3,2).2$.
\end{itemize}
%Moreover, ``this group has an outer automorphism of order $2$ whose fixed
%point subgroup is isomorphic to $J_1$."
\item $J_4$. This is characterized as a finite simple group that
  contains an involution with centralizer isomorphic to
  $2^{1+12}_{-}\cdot 3\cdot M_{22}:2$.  ``The centralizer is nonsplit
  over the [$2$-core] $O_2$ and contains a perfect group $6\cdot
  M_{22}$."  Moreover, the simple group has order
  $2^{21}3^35.7.11^3.23.29.31.37.43$ \cite[p.152]{robert1998twelve}.
\item Ru.  A permutation group is defined to have rank $r$ if it is
  transitive and a point stabilizer has $r$ orbits.  This group is
  characterized as a rank $3$ finite simple group whose point
  stabilizer is $H = {}^2F_4(2)$, the Ree group over the field with
  $2$ elements. (As described above, the derived group of $H$ is the
  Tits group.) \cite[p.151]{robert1998twelve}
\end{itemize}
 

\section{Checking the Answer}

If proofs are not included in the statement of the theorem, what
sanity checks are there to make sure that the specification is
correct?  One possibility that has been discussed is the following.
There is currently a bridge between Mathematica and Lean, constructed
by Rob Lewis and Minchao Wu \cite{L}.  Lean is also now available as a
package in CoCalc (which also provides access to GAP).  We can hope
that further development will provide a bridge (at some indefinite day
in the future) that would allow for some sanity checks by running some
GAP calculations based on the Lean specification and comparing to
known answers.  We can discuss what might be done here.
